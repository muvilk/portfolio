        <h2>Project Gobble</h2>
        <p>
          "Gobble" is an innovative dining review app designed to simplify the
          decision-making process for food enthusiasts in Singapore, where the
          choice of eateries can be overwhelming. This centralized platform
          distinguishes itself by pooling reviews from multiple sources like
          Google Business, SmartLocal, TikTok, and direct user feedback. What
          sets Gobble apart is its ability to offer personalized restaurant
          recommendations that align with individual user profiles, budget
          limits, and specific culinary preferences. It leverages OpenAI's
          advanced Language Models (LLMs) for several features, including
          personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behaviour,
          sentiment analysis of reviews to determine overall dining experiences,
          and natural language processing to categorize and synthesize data
          effectively. The technical backbone of Gobble incorporates APIs from
          major platforms for robust review aggregation, and leverages mapping
          and geolocation services to aid users in finding eateries nearby or in
          new areas. It also features sophisticated data visualization tools
          that enable users to compare restaurants on several metrics visually,
          enhancing the user experience and providing clear, actionable
          insights. This combination of technological sophistication and
          user-focused design makes Gobble a comprehensive tool for making
          informed dining choices in Singapore.
